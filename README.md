news-alert-discord
===

Note: Development on this version has stopped, I'm doing stuff in https://github.com/darrenwatt/xml-to-discord-post which is the same but just scraping XML feeds.
The problem with this version (scraping html) is BBC News keep changing their CSS which means continuous changes to the code to keep scraping working.
XML doesn't have this problem. Use XML.
